# Energy Usage Predictor (Regression Analysis)

# Overview
This project predicts hourly energy consumption (in watts) for a residential building using regression analysis. By learning patterns from historical electricity usage data, the model estimates future energy demand based on time-related factors such as seasonality and usage trends.
Accurate energy forecasting can help improve energy planning, reduce operational costs, and support sustainability initiatives. This repository is designed to be easy to understand, easy to run, and safe for open-source use, even for readers without a technical background.

# Dataset
The dataset contains hourly residential power usage data collected from smart meters in a building located in Houston, Texas.

# Source: Kaggle
Dataset name: Residential Power Usage (3 Years, Time Series)

# Data Usage Notice
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.

No personally identifiable information (PII) is included.

This project is intended for educational and research purposes only.

Please review and comply with Kaggle’s dataset license before redistributing the raw data.



# Project Workflow
Step 1: Import libraries
Step 2: Load the data
Step 3: Data preprocessing
Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and outlier detection
Step 5: Train a linear regression model using walk-forward validation
Step 6: Make predictions
Step 7: Evaluate performance using RMSE and R²
Step 8: Visualize predictions

# Key Observations
Energy usage decreased during 2020–2021.
Seasonal usage patterns shifted between early and late parts of the year.
Outliers were observed in early 2016 and late 2020, which should be removed for predictive modeling.

# Legal and Open-Source Considerations
This project does not involve personal data or restricted systems. Data is available for public
All code is intended for open-source use.
Suitable for educational and research purposes.
