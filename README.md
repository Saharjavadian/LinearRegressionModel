# Energy Usage Predictor (Regression Analysis)
This project uses regression analysis to predict energy consumption (in watts) based on input features like temperature, time of day, etc.
Accurately forecasting energy usage helps optimize resource allocation, reduce costs, and support sustainability efforts. This project builds and evaluates regression model to predict wattage usage.
The dataset contains hourly energy usage logs collected from smart meters, combined with contextual features like outdoor temperature
