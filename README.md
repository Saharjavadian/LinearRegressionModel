# Energy Usage Predictor (Regression Analysis)
This project uses regression analysis to predict energy consumption (in watts) based on input features like temperature, time of day, etc.
Accurately forecasting energy usage helps optimize resource allocation, reduce costs, and support sustainability efforts. This project builds and evaluates regression model to predict wattage usage.

# The steps are outlined below
Step1: Import libraries<br>
Step2: load data<br>
Step3: Exploratory ddata analysis (EDA). This step consists of the following actions:<br>
       A: report on the general info like, the number of rows and columns and missing points<br>
       B: Outlier detection. If you are doing the root cause analysis you should keep these outliers but if you are building a predictive model , these outliers should be deleted.<br>
