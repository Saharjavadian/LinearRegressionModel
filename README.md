# Energy Usage Predictor (Regression Analysis)

# Overview
This project.......

# Dataset
The dataset includes simulated energy data coming from buildings that vary in glazing area, glazing area distribution, orientation, and other design parameters. Different combinations of these characteristics result in 768 distinct building configurations. The dataset contains 768 samples with 8 features and is used to predict two continuous target variables.

# Project Workflow
Step 1: Import libraries

Step 2: Load the open source 

Step 3: Reporting on the collinearity between variables by Heatmap chart

Step 4: Train a multiple linear regression  and make a prediction

Step 7: Evaluate performance using RMSE and R² and reporting on the coefficients

Step 8: Optimize the multiple linear regression to find the best fit with LassoCV

Step 8: Visualize predictions

Step 9: Visualize residuals
